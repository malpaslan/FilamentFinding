# FilamentFinding
Minimal spanning tree based filament finder for galaxy redshift survey data. Algorithm explained in full in Alpaslan et al. (2014).

For now, this code is shared as is. What this means is that it is hard wired to be run on data and catalogues from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. However, it should be reasonably straightforward to edit the code to use other data sources. If anything, this is an easy way to understand how the algorithm works.

Time permitting, updates to this repository will make the code less hardwired for certain data sets and allow a more plug-and-play approach. Stay tuned, and sorry for the slow updates!
